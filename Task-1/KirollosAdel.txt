Hi everyone, my name is Kirollos Adel and I am the Co-Head of the cybersecurity track in GDG BNU (not flexing ofc)

I want to learn backend development because it seems really fun to be honest and also because cybersecurity is a late game build and I need something during the laning phase (MOBA refrences are peak ik)
